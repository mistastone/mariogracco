      <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
        <p>The next Federal Election will be fought on a number of issues. The issues that are important to me and I believe, the people of King and Vaughan are:</p>

        <p class="listdata">1. The Economy</p>
        <p class="listdata">2. Unemployment, especially for our youth community</p>
        <p class="listdata">3. National and International events on security and terrorism</p>
        <p class="listdata">4. Infrastructure and the lack of it</p>
        <p class="listdata">5. Working with the provincial and municipal partners to coordinate better investments needed to keep our communities healthy and vibrant</p>
        <p class="listdata">6. Reduce gridlock so that the people have more family time and the economy will benefit much better</p> 
        
        <p>There are many more issues that are important to you and I want to hear from you, so that together we can decide on the issues to address in the Parliament of Canada.</p>
