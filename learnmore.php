      <h2>Why I Want to be Your MP in King–Vaughan</h2>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
				<p>I know the riding very well, and have spent more than 30 years working with people throughout the community. I want to continue this work on your behalf in Ottawa, helping to plan and deliver initiatives that are important to you as residents and will make Canada a better place to live, work and play. Here are some of the key issues that I believe are vitally important. I hope you agree.</p>

				<p class="listitem">1. The Economy</p>
				<p class="listdata">The current government has mismanaged our economy and, perhaps even worse, has mislead us about it. Recently we were promised a surplus in 2015, but now independent economists are predicting another deficit because of the poor economic decisions made by the Conservatives. It is time for more sensible, sustainable and visionary economic policy.</p> 
				
				<p class="listitem">2. Unemployment</p>
				<p class="listdata">Many of our children are well educated, but are not able to find a job related to their education. This must be a top priority, ensuring that our young people have the same hope for the future that we had.</p>

				<p class="listitem">3. Health Care/Child Care</p>
				<p class="listdata">I believe that government has an important role to play in the health and well-being of everyone in Canada. This means developing comprehensive, coherent, sustainable plans – and the funding to go with them, working in cooperation with the provinces and front-line service providers. No government can afford to pay for everything all the time, but we have to take a thoughtful, strategic approach based not on money but on priorities. This thinking should apply to child care as well as health care – providing the supports people need as a foundation for our future. From our youngest children to our growing population of seniors, and among the middle class who are trying to make ends meet, I believe the federal government should be vigilant in ensuring that the services people count on are always available.</p>

				<p class="listitem">4. Security</p>
				<p class="listdata">We are all frightened by acts of terrorism – including on our own soil. We need a firm but measured response – standing up to terrorism while not exposing Canada to unnecessary risks. Our current Prime Minister appears more interested in publicity than security.</p> 
				
				<p class="listitem">5. Infrastructure</p>
				<p class="listdata">We need to invest more in our infrastructure – roads, bridges, sewers, electricity, and especially public transportation. This has been a key priority for the Ontario government, but the federal government has too often refused to participate with their reasonable share of the costs.</p>
				
				<p class="listitem">6. Gridlock</p>
				<p class="listdata">Much discussion has taken place about improving transportation, yet the federal government continues to stall and has refused to partner on this critical issue. Local investments in transportation – both for public transit users and for motorists and commercial vehicles – will improve our economy and our quality of life. It is time to get on with it, with all levels of government contributing.</p>

				<p class="listitem">7. All levels of government working together</p>
				<p class="listdata">The federal government needs to work in cooperation with provincial and municipal partners. This would allow for much better planning and coordination on where and how to invest in our infrastructure, education, health care and job creation. Too often, the current Prime Minister has ignored provinces and municipalities – he refuses to attend when the Premiers meet and did not even speak to the Premier of Ontario for more than a year. This is unacceptable. We need to work together, providing thoughtful, coordinated decisions.</p>

				<p>These are just a few of the issues I believe are important. I want to hear from you about what is on your mind and your ideas for how to make things better, so that I can effectively represent your views to the Parliament of Canada and ensure that the federal government makes good decisions on your behalf.</p>
